## TODOs
- Review code (I do have less knowledge about using xtext correctly)
- Correct approach to meta-model? (Looking at the [old cooperate tutorial](https://github.com/Cooperate-Project/CooperateModelingEnvironment/wiki/Creating-a-Textual-Editor)
- Adding way more unit tests
- Implement more validation (what else?)
- Implement issue resolution (what?)
- *Start with the M2M-transformation...*
